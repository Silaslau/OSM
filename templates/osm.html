      <h2>Instruction</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of our model is to <strong> match each photo with the corresponding OpenStreetMap (OSM) elements </strong> as shown in the GIS map. Therefore, we only focus on <strong> OSM objects </strong> — those features that can also be observed on the map. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this evaluation, there are <strong> five </strong> examples. Each example features two pictures and a corresponding text description:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Left Picture (Real Photo):</strong> Shows the actual scene with bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right Picture (GIS Map):</strong> Displays the shooting location on a map, with an arrow indicating the direction from which the left photo was taken. 
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong> Picture description: </strong> Describes the objects detected in the left photo (with bounding boxes) that can also be observed in the right map.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        For each example, please answer the following three questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>How is the amount of labeled or described content?</strong><br>
          Check whether all significant objects in the photo are included and clearly marked, without imporant elements missing or irrelevant items added.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How accurate is the textual description?</strong><br>
          Determine whether each object is described correctly in terms of its appearance, location, or function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How accurate are the positions of the image annotations (bounding boxes)?</strong><br>
          Assess whether each bounding box is placed correctly around the intended object, accurately reflecting its location and boundaries.
        </li>
      </ol>

      </div>

      <div class="text-box">
        <strong>Picture Description:</strong> <br>
        <strong>1. Forest-Covered Hill (Left Side):</strong> <br>
        Located between the left 70 to left 30-degree angle from our viewpoint, you’ll see a gently sloping hill dressed in lush green vegetation and shrubs. This area adds a beautiful, natural contrast to the man-made structures ahead. The forest appears quite close—just 10 to 30 meters away—creating a serene and calming edge to the scene. <br><br>
        <strong>2. Forest Patch on Hilly Terrain (Right Side):</strong> <br>
        Shifting your gaze now to the right 30 to right 70-degree area, you’ll notice smaller patches of trees and shrubs, resting on undulating, hilly ground. This section of forest feels a bit more scattered and wild compared to the slope on the left. It’s situated slightly farther—around 15 to 50 meters from us—contributing to the layered depth of the landscape. <br><br>
        <strong>3. Jockey Club Global Graduate Tower:</strong> <br>
        Still on the left side, within the 70 to 30-degree viewing angle, stands the Jockey Club Global Graduate Tower. This multi-story residential building is designed to accommodate postgraduate students. With a prominent, structured appearance, it’s located approximately 30 to 50 meters away and rises above the greenery, marking a transition from natural to urban. <br><br>
        <strong>4. Jockey Club i-Village:</strong> <br>
        Moving closer to the center of our view, from left 20 to right 10 degrees, we come across the Jockey Club i-Village. This is a large, multi-story building distinguished by its blue-gray exterior and an array of windows that hint at its residential or institutional use. Positioned about 30 to 50 meters away, its modern design gives it a commanding presence in this part of the scene. <br><br>
        <strong>5. HKUST Lee Shau Kee Business Building:</strong> <br>
        Finally, on the right side between 20 and 70 degrees, we find the Lee Shau Kee Business Building belonging to HKUST. It stands out with its modern glass-panel facade, offering a sleek, contemporary contrast to the forest surrounding it. Nestled among trees, this building is about 30 to 60 meters away, harmonizing technology, business, and nature in one visual frame. <br>

The building stands at an approximate distance of 40 to 67 meters, slightly elevated and confidently positioned in the landscape. <br><br>
        <strong>2. Shaw Auditorium:</strong><br>
        Now shift your attention to the center of the scene, spanning from left 23 to right 53 degrees. Right there is the stunning Shaw Auditorium, a masterpiece of contemporary architecture. It stands out with its smooth white circular design, exuding elegance and openness. It feels quite close—just 20 to 22 meters away—inviting and accessible as a center for performance, gathering, and cultural exchange.
